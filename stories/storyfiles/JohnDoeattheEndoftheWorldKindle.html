        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The tiny bar was warm and almost full, which surprised me. By 2am I was usually
                        already closing if Davey wasn&rsquo;t around. I think that maybe the regulars had started
                        warming up to me,
                        wanted to stick around until it was late. I was happy and young, drinking with Richard as the
                        others
                        entertained themselves and slowly passed out on the couch, armchairs and stools. He had been
                        going on about
                        someone from the warehouse for the past hour, and not for a single moment did I stop to try and
                        actually get
                        what he was saying.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">From what I understood, someone was being an ass to him, or they were being
                        bossy, or
                        they said something bad; I didn&rsquo;t really care, but he needed to talk and no one else would
                        not tell
                        him to shut up. It was dark and cold outside, the alien reminded us of that as he opened the
                        door and stood
                        outside for a moment, staring into the place, at us. Other than me and Richard, all of the
                        people still
                        there were long time regulars, all of the people there lived in Whiterock most of their lives,
                        all of the
                        people there knew everyone at Whiterock, and all of the people there knew that one of us
                        wouldn&rsquo;t walk
                        into the bar that late, just like we all knew we had never seen that man before in our
                        lives.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tall, uncomfortably so in that small hole in the wall. Pale, worryingly so; he
                        looked
                        like he&rsquo;d lost a quart or two of blood. Blonde, disconcertingly so; his hair was so blonde
                        it was
                        almost white. - I&rsquo;ve got a flier. May I pin it to your notice board? - the man asked
                        calmly in a
                        foreign accent, and after a brief moment, I nodded. With a confident step he walked to the
                        board, swiftly
                        took a pin from it and stuck the note in place. He thanked me as he bowed and then walked
                        outside, taking
                        that same pause after opening the door.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He went as he came, but it thankfully threw Rick out of his loop. - Fuck&rsquo;s
                        his
                        problem? - he laughed loudly, and then the others in the bar joined him. - You guys want to make
                        a bet? -
                        Matthew asked, suddenly bright in the head - How did he get here? Sailor or rail worker? - and
                        with that,
                        the bar was alive again. Everyone pitched into the discussion, even the two guys who were
                        snoring before
                        trying to order another beer.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>An hour later, everyone but Rick had gone home. He always stuck around like old gum on
                        weekends,
                        usually didn&rsquo;t help with closing, though it&rsquo;s not like he worked there with me and
                        Dave, I
                        shouldn&rsquo;t complain. Somehow he managed to walk up to the board, but even more impressive
                        was that he
                        managed to read the flier out loud. - &ldquo;Heaven is coming. Be ready.&rdquo; What a load of
                        shit. - He
                        said, I laughed and shook my head as I replied - I should&rsquo;ve made a bet that he was some
                        kind of angel
                        instead of a rail guy. - Rick flipped me off before laughing and saying goodbye. Soon after I
                        was home, dead
                        tired like always, but that night I just had trouble sleeping. Someway, that &ldquo;angel&rdquo;
                        shook me
                        up. I thought that it was because he&rsquo;d been the first outsider to show up after me and
                        Richard.</span>
                <hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;">
        </p>
        <h1 class="c11" id="h.ze62nccfwqkc"><span class="c8">2: Anniversary</span></h1>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Late October was always a slow time in town, but when the anniversary rolled
                        around,
                        everyone came out to the snow and partied for a day or two. The quiet rail yard and slow moving
                        docks were
                        always colorfully decorated just like the narrow streets and alleys of the town, and people
                        would dance on
                        the streets all day. Those of us who knew how to play an instrument would as everybody sang
                        along to the
                        couple of old folk songs of Whiterock until the light ran out.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The festivals are always labeled as B.Y.O.B., but since the single market in town
                        barely has any alcohol, it always fell on the two bars to try and supply for all the drinkers,
                        and every
                        year there would be a secret competition. Old Dave and Millard had a long standing bet: the
                        person who sells
                        less has to drink at the other&rsquo;s bar for a month. If you asked Dave and MIllard,
                        they&rsquo;d tell you
                        they hated each other, but everyone knew they &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;were two of the tightest friends
                        in town;
                        probably because of how often they&rsquo;d start bets with each other.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Everyone was dancing and chatting and partying while me, Davey and Millard were
                        working from tents while freezing our asses off. Of course, Rick loved laughing at me, right
                        until Millard
                        realized what was going on and I pushed Rick onto him. He fought it &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp;and complained until money was mentioned. I never saw Rick working that hard ever
                        again, he
                        probably wanted to hold the win over me.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">When night came, those who could still stay up commemorated at home with parties
                        and
                        dinners, while those who didn&rsquo;t think they were drunk enough went to one of the two bars.
                        It was
                        magical, the close knit people of Whiterock came together once a year &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        like no other day. There was no gossip, no fighting, no arguing, only celebration. Me and
                        Richard
                        hadn&rsquo;t been there long, only about 3 months, but that day was the last day in a while
                        where things
                        felt like the normal we had gotten used to.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just as Dave invited me for dinner after work, so did Martha invite Rick, but we
                        declined their invites. We figured the two zombies should stick together once in a while, get
                        each other
                        caught up on their lives.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He roasted some meat for us, can&rsquo;t remember the cut for the life of me, and
                        I
                        made the vegetables and salad. I did take on more work, but he was still really buzzed from the
                        whole day of
                        doing &ldquo;quality assurance&rdquo; on Millard&rsquo;s supply. When we showed up in town,
                        shambling out of
                        our ship which we had nearly crashed onto the docks, Martha was the first one to find us before
                        quickly
                        calling help from all the other people around. I don&rsquo;t remember much of that first week,
                        all I
                        remember is a vague blur of fishing, selling at different ports, and then doing more fishing.
                        Neither of us
                        knows how long that lasted.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>Martha got us jobs at the warehouses, and Rick took to it nicely, but I couldn&rsquo;t
                        handle
                        it. After complaining to Dave a few too many times, the old sod figured he was getting old
                        enough to admit
                        he could use help and hired me. In his words: &ldquo;You look like the kind of guy who&rsquo;s
                        too afraid of
                        falling onto the shelves to drink on the job.&rdquo; Overall, we were doing good, even if Rick
                        complained
                        about his job often, it was more in the way that an old married couple loves to bicker.</span>
                <hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;">
        </p>
        <h1 class="c11" id="h.2rlvcmyy9un2"><span>3: </span><span>Murmurs</span></h1>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wasn&rsquo;t long before the whole town had been talking about the flyers pinned
                        and
                        glued all around. Despite that, it seemed like no one else had seen the stranger, or rather, no
                        one paid any
                        attention to him. &ldquo;Heaven is coming.&rdquo;, what could that mean? To some it was an early
                        warning
                        that Jesus would return soon. Some said it was just a lunatic from one of the boats spreading
                        rumors for
                        fun. Some said aliens. But everyone who believed it thought it had something to do with the end
                        of times.
                        Believing it or not though, everyone would not talk about anything but the flyers.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>That night shift was hell at first, but as people became drunker and drunker it got better.
                        A
                        lot of the old folk always get real quiet and slow after a couple of drinks, and the others get
                        loud and
                        stammery but usually incoherent enough to be entertaining. Things were off that night, the town
                        had been
                        thrown into a weird mood with all the rumors, and not having Dave or
                </span><span>Rick</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;around didn&rsquo;t help, but worse was that everyone
                        went home early. I was alone in the
                        bar with the radio and a magazine of crosswords.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t have a reason to actually stay open until the hours Davey had
                        asked me
                        to, normally people stopped showing up by midnight and Dave himself closed if the bar was empty
                        past 1am,
                        but at the same time I felt a sort of obligation brought by a code of honor or&hellip; whatever.
                        Had it not
                        been for that, I wouldn&rsquo;t have met Mack. The misplaced cowboy was meek in his entrance,
                        taking care
                        not to make much noise and excused himself as he walked in and tapped his boots on the doorframe
                        outside.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Despite the way he entered the Fountain, he ported himself in a confident way,
                        with a
                        drop of worry. After saying our pleasantries, he asked for some gin with a squeeze of lime, but
                        settled for
                        lemon, and then kept quiet. For ten minutes none of us had the gall to say something, and it
                        wasn&rsquo;t
                        until he made a move to get up that I stopped him and asked where he was from. He replied with a
                        guilty
                        laugh, and avoided a straight answer.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>- Not from around here. Just got on a ride and next thing I knew I was freezing. Say, are
                </span><span>there</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;any hotels or inns or anything &lsquo;round here? - I
                        shook my
                        head in response.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">- Planning to stay the night? </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">- I have to, &nbsp;but I couldn&rsquo;t find any places open other than
                        this.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He looked at me, almost lost in thought, but still judging me, then shook his
                        head
                        and asked for a beer. Despite his looks and the way he&rsquo;d talk from time to time, he was
                        well mannered,
                        polite. Was curious about the place, which was weird. How could he have ended up here without
                        knowing
                        anything about it? With the way he spoke, all he knew was the name, how cold it was and the
                        amount of ships
                        that stop there on a daily basis. Mack asked a lot, yet somehow had tight-lips. The only way I
                        could get him
                        to tell me why he&rsquo;d come here was by letting him crash on my couch.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He was looking for a friend who&rsquo;d come to town recently. I offered to help
                        him,
                        to see if I&rsquo;d seen that guy, but he didn&rsquo;t have any description as to who he was or
                        what he
                        looked like. When I asked why, he shook his head.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>- We only write to each other. Truth be told he </span><span>don&rsquo;t</span><span
                        class="c1">&nbsp;even know I&rsquo;m looking for him. Hopefully. - I raised an eyebrow -
                        It&rsquo;s
                        a&hellip; surprise. Just that. - he added after a long pause. That cowboy was a liar through and
                        through,
                        but I took pity on him. That night, he slept on my couch, and went away in the morning after
                        trying hard to
                        pay me. He was after the foreigner that showed up a couple of weeks before, that much was
                        obvious.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0"><span>When I told Richard about it, he asked why I didn&rsquo;t tell Mack about the stranger.
                        &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t my business,&rdquo; is what I told him, and he shook his head before
                        pointing at one
                        of the leaflets, still stuck on the walls. - &ldquo;Heaven is coming.&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t sound
                        like
                        everyone&rsquo;s business? - I nodded in response. He was right, but so was I. - If we die
                        because of you,
                        I&rsquo;ll find a way to punch you, somehow. - he said in a half serious tone, and we laughed. I
                        wasn&rsquo;t sure yet if I had fucked up or not.</span>
                <hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;">

        <h1 class="c11" id="h.4cn28uchkyh1"><span class="c8">4: News</span></h1>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Over the weeks, we hadn&rsquo;t gotten many sailors or trains coming from any of
                        the
                        cities nearby. Everyone who was asked about the leaflets just looked confused and shook their
                        heads. Some
                        took them on their trips, but it&rsquo;d be a while before we&rsquo;d see those people again.
                        With nothing
                        but mountains around us for miles and miles, we didn&rsquo;t have phones to call family or any
                        of the
                        shipping companies that worked with us, and none of the radio towers in town could reach far
                        enough to
                        reliably talk to anyone that wasn&rsquo;t in a boat or ship. We were pretty much stranded.
                        Normally it made
                        folks peaceful, we didn&rsquo;t have to worry much about the rest of the world, but now it just
                        made the
                        unease slowly grow.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">People saw both the cowboy and that outsider, some talked to them too, and so
                        naturally they became the talk of the town for a while. No one knew how they came, or where
                        from. No one saw
                        them hopping from a train or ship to confirm any suspicions. Still, I believe that Mack came by
                        train in the
                        middle of the night, or close to it, it seemed like something that man would do. The courier
                        though, hell,
                        he might as well have jumped down at us from the mountains all around.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Of course though, with not much happening, the talks slowed down even if they
                        never
                        died. Time passed, a lot of the leaflets got torn or taken down, people stopped asking around
                        about the
                        cowboy or the courier. I got better at taking care of the bar, Rick became a mountain and got
                        close with the
                        rest of the warehouse crew. Davey got older, as did Millard. For a short moment, life was
                        peaceful again,
                        until a blood-curdling scream came down from the mountains in one late afternoon.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Terrance, who lived on the edge of town, was one of the first to hear it, and
                        while
                        he got other people to call for help, he ran up the steps carved into the rockface, searching
                        for the
                        screamer with gun in hand. Once people started screaming for help around the streets and alleys,
                        everyone
                        who could stop ran outside and towards the edge of town, and soon enough other people followed
                        after
                        Terrance.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I didn&rsquo;t go, but Rickie did. It took a while for any of them to come back,
                        two
                        hours maybe, and when they did, anyone that hadn&rsquo;t gone home yet was shooed away. Later
                        that night,
                        Richard told me all about what had happened. Maryanne was in shock even as they came down the
                        stairs leading
                        up to the plateau and mountains. They&rsquo;d found her on the ground, barely able to make out a
                        word,
                        shaking violently. She was as pale as the ice up north, and about as cold as it too, but her
                        pulse was
                        faster than a scared horse.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Despite that, the men couldn&rsquo;t find anything on the scene. No trail, no
                        marks,
                        no smells or sounds that were unnatural to the forest, there was just her empty body there. It
                        wasn&rsquo;t
                        a seizure, Maryanne never had any of those, and a scream like the one that echoed down to the
                        town was
                        something only pure horror could bring out of someone. It took days for her to recover, but from
                        time to
                        time she&rsquo;d babble or scream about certain things.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>&ldquo;Fly&rdquo;, &ldquo;severed&rdquo;, &ldquo;blue&rdquo;, &ldquo;horse&rdquo; and
                        &ldquo;star&rdquo;. Among the words that Rick and the other men told me about, those were the
                        ones that
                        stuck to me. &ldquo;Heaven is coming.&rdquo; is what I told Richard when he asked me what I
                        thought of it
                        all, and he laughed. We were both unsure if that was the answer or not.</span>
                <hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;">
        </p>
        <h1 class="c11" id="h.40vflmx1i149"><span class="c8">5: New Worker</span></h1>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">About a week after Maryanne&rsquo;s incident, someone new arrived in town. A man
                        who
                        was a little on the short side, but very stocky. Had short hair, light in color, and a rough
                        beard. Seemed
                        very much to be just the kind of guy who&rsquo;d fit in with the other railroad workers, and of
                        course, he
                        was looking for work. Asking for it was the very first thing he &nbsp;did when he hopped off the
                        train. Not
                        even the people of Whiterock were so trusting as to give a job on the spot to someone like
                        that.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>I happened to be at the railyard that hour, dealing with some stuff related to the
                        bar&rsquo;s
                        stocks, when I saw him leaning by the corner of one of the buildings, lighting a cigarette. He
                        was new in
                        town and was obviously not just a visitor, of course I got curious. Introduced myself with an
                        open hand.
                        &ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m Kerry. You alright?&rdquo; and that made him perk up. He had a firm
                        handshake and
                </span><span>put</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;of a lot of emphasis on making sure the base of our thumbs
                        were
                        against each other. It was obvious that that man was desperate to make a good impression.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He introduced himself as either Don or Dom. I&rsquo;m unsure because he&rsquo;d
                        often
                        change the way he pronounced it. We talked for a little while, curious to know about each other,
                        but he was
                        all closed up, tighter than Daniele&rsquo;s pickle jars. Of course, I was cautious in return.
                        According to
                        him, he&rsquo;d found trouble in almost everywhere else he went trying to look for work, so he
                        came to our
                        little town in hopes of turning his life around. That sounded like a half truth, I wanted to
                        know more, give
                        him some of our hospitality in return for some talk.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He liked the decor of the bar, liked the faint smell of spilled alcohol and
                        cigarette
                        ash, liked the warm warm lighting and soft seats, he praised it without end even before
                        I&rsquo;d handed him
                        anything. He called himself Dominique, had come from a couple cities over, would be thirty-one
                        in two
                        months. The more we drank, the more it seemed as if there was someone earnest deep in there. At
                        the very
                        least he was able to keep his story straight. When I asked if he&rsquo;d only take a job working
                        the
                        railyard, he thought for a while.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like it more if I could be there, but at this point if nothing
                        in
                        the railyard or docks comes up, I could take something else.&rdquo; It was obvious he was asking
                        me for help
                        without asking, but I nodded. After that hour or two, I&rsquo;d come to like him enough to give
                        him a shake
                        regardless of what lies he was telling us. Soon enough people started filling up the bar and he
                        stopped
                        getting free drinks. Richard came in, I introduced Dominique to him and some of the others and
                        let them
                        figure it out while I stepped out to talk with Dave.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">- Who the fuck is that guy? I don&rsquo;t like him. - Dave was rarely so quick to
                        judge someone. Most people could tell something about him reeked, or maybe we were all just
                        paranoid, some
                        more than others, though I don&rsquo;t think that was the case. Both me and Richard received
                        much better
                        treatment than anyone had given Dominique so far, but he didn&rsquo;t help himself either. - I
                        don&rsquo;t
                        know. - I replied - He&rsquo;s not good but&hellip; he&rsquo;s not all bad either. - Dave
                        scoffed in
                        response. His old lips contorted in disapproval.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">- So, what&rsquo;s he like? I saw him walking around earlier, he looks like
                        fly-paper. - grumbled the old man, and I laughed while nodding. - There&rsquo;s something not
                        bad, maybe
                        even good in there. If you don&rsquo;t trust me, go in yourself and serve him a few drinks.
                        What&rsquo;s bad
                        is him being here. - Dave made a noise, like he often did. - You want him here? - he asked, and
                        I thought
                        for a while, before nodding. - I did say I&rsquo;d try to help. Guys at the docks and yard are
                        better judges
                        than me, if they don&rsquo;t like him after a week or two, then they can get rid of him. - Dave
                        nodded and
                        waved me away, towards the street.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>Told me it was my responsibility and to take care of it, before going into the bar and
                        assumedly
                        beginning to serve people. It got loud soon after he walked in. I didn&rsquo;t think anyone at
                        the docks
                        would care for me, honestly. Thought my word would be as good as a kid&rsquo;s, but I&rsquo;d
                        told those two
                        I&rsquo;d do something, and now it was my problem.</span>

        <h1 class="c11" id="h.w7p8tet70yg4"><span class="c8">6: Cheers</span></h1>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Christmas was right around the corner, but Rick and I decided it&rsquo;d be nice
                        to
                        get together for dinner anyways. An excuse to catch up and scream at each other. He gave the
                        idea of cooking
                        and eating in the boat, and of course I called him dumb, but he insisted. According to him,
                        &ldquo;the clean
                        up is just more time spent together.&rdquo; We&rsquo;d kept the ship after arriving in
                        Whiterock, we
                        didn&rsquo;t know who it belonged to anyways.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was old, small, but had a kitchen and four beds. We remember living in it for
                        a
                        while. Rick says that we had two other guys working with us for some time, but I could never
                        remember that.
                        Either way, we&rsquo;d pretty much forgotten all about the little we could remember of that
                        time. It was all
                        just a blur now. We ended up spending the whole afternoon getting it in decent enough shape to
                        eat
                        in.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rick brought most of the ingredients. Some pickles he made himself, stuff to make
                        biscuits and a venison stew using fresh meat one of the hunters in town had gifted him. I
                        brought the rest
                        and the beer. While he started on the biscuits, I worked on the stew. Before we&rsquo;d ended up
                        in
                        Whiterock, I remember thinking of him as a pretty scary guy, but maybe that&rsquo;s because of
                        where I was.
                        People liked him there, probably much more than they liked me. Not that anybody really disliked
                        anybody in
                        that town, but it&rsquo;s easier to be loved by everyone when you&rsquo;re an unstoppable
                        mountain.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">We always said we were getting together to talk, but I think most often I
                        didn&rsquo;t talk a lot unless he was cutting work to complain to me in the bar. The boys at the
                        warehouse
                        were well, healthy. Martha was as gossipy as ever, Joanne still didn&rsquo;t pay him any real
                        attention,
                        and, more importantly, Maryanne had begun to recover. The two doctors in town waved off what she
                        had been
                        saying as a fever dream, but they didn&rsquo;t have a real explanation for what had left her
                        that way. Poor
                        Maryanne could barely describe it either.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">- I went back there a couple days after. I smelled smoke not far from the place
                        we
                        found her. - he remarked - It was a campfire. Extinguished and half burnt. - According to him,
                        it
                        couldn&rsquo;t have been from one of the hunters. He was pretty sure no one had been out hunting
                        that day,
                        not that he asked, but none of them hunted that close to town. - Are you saying someone scared
                        Maryanne, and
                        that person is still up there? - I asked, and he shrugged. - Maybe. - I questioned why he
                        didn&rsquo;t ask
                        or tell others about the campfire, and he got silent.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">- I don&rsquo;t want trouble with the wrong people. - I wanted to judge him,
                        complain, but I couldn&rsquo;t. We just got to more talking and some gossip, mostly about and
                        around the bar
                        by that point of the night. We both remember meeting each other for the first time, he looked
                        strong and
                        angry, and according to him I looked to be out of my depth. I think we had been hired by someone
                        or some
                        company at some shipyard a thousand miles away from Whiterock and fished our way north-west
                        towards it. I
                        never found out why Rich was there at that office, I just remember at that time he looked
                        dangerous, and
                        after that I figured it was best not to ask about it, but he has told me some things about his
                        life before
                        it.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>I know he had a few brothers and sisters and I know he finished at least middle school. He
                        was
                        always smart, but the way he spoke about it, makes it seem like he dropped out of high school.
                        He was a
                        strong kid, got in trouble because of it a lot, but he told me he was always happy when he was
                        young, always
                        getting into fights, but did the best he could to straighten himself when his youngest brothers
                        and sisters
                        were born. He missed his home, after all, it was the reason he&rsquo;d eventually leave
                        Whiterock.</span>

        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>After New Year&rsquo;s, like usual, the town started firing on all cylinders. Trains came in
                        and
                        out all day, as did boats. Some bringing fish, others moving cargo. The jumpsuits were busy,
                        being busy made
                        them hungry and tired, hungry jumpsuits made restaurants happy, and tired jumpsuits made me,
                        Dave, Millard
                        and I happy. According to nearly all of the old timers, that </span><span>was being
                        an</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;especially good early season. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Early into the season was when Dominique proved himself, people in the yard began
                        to
                        like him. Dom was good at his job, it seemed like he just instinctively knew where each crate
                        should go,
                        sure, he got it wrong sometimes, everyone did, but he was one of the quickest on the uptake. For
                        a
                        self-described &ldquo;drifter&rdquo;, he was really good at that job. But, barely two weeks
                        later, he
                        stopped by my apartment, handed me a wad of cash. I asked why. &ldquo;Paying off my debt to you,
                        it&rsquo;s
                        time for me to leave.&rdquo; is more or less what he said before giving me a smile and quickly
                        walking away.
                        I didn&rsquo;t have time to react.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not long after, for the first time that the flyers came up again. One of the boys
                        from the Hetsun Cargo Company was friends with the rail director and had been asked about the
                        flyers when
                        they showed up. He handed an exact replica of the flier to the director. &ldquo;This showed up
                        about three
                        towns south, a little after when it did here.&rdquo; And just like that, the chaos came
                        back.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">A hoax? A cult? No one knew, but it riled the town up. Some were worried, some
                        laughed it off, most didn&rsquo;t really know what to make of it, but whenever the two opposites
                        met,
                        it&rsquo;d lead to long discussions and loud arguments. Maryanne, poor girl, she didn&rsquo;t
                        handle it
                        well. We became friends, in part because I was one of the only people he believed her story. I
                        remember how
                        much she shook the first time she tried to tell me about it. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She&rsquo;d gone up the mountains to try and clear her head. After an hour of
                        walking
                        around, she heard a noise coming from a clearing, she couldn&rsquo;t describe it. Every time she
                        tried, it
                        changed, what mattered was that it froze her, and soon after she saw a headless &nbsp;corpse
                        walking by her.
                        When what was left of its neck turned towards her, that&rsquo;s when the whole town heard her.
                        But the
                        details changed almost every time she tried telling the story. Sometimes the corpse had a head,
                        but not
                        skin, sometimes it held its face on one of its hands as it walked, sometimes it was its head.
                        Sometimes it
                        was alone, sometimes there was someone else there, alive.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was afraid but had nowhere to go, sometimes she couldn&rsquo;t even leave the
                        apartment to go to work at Jeremiah&rsquo;s Diner. Of course, most of the town chipped in to
                        help, but being
                        alone in her own apartment most of the time didn&rsquo;t do her much good. Richard tried to talk
                        too, but he
                        wasn&rsquo;t one for words, never was. Still, she always told me she was determined to go back
                        to that
                        place, look at it for herself, I offered to go with, and she thanked me, but denied it.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Life was hectic at that time, and I&rsquo;d thought that it couldn&rsquo;t get
                        any
                        worse, until mid-February, when I found the cowboy in town once again. Out by the rails, not too
                        far from
                        any building, he was playing a sad song on his guitar, late at night. The only light near him
                        was his
                        cigarette. I just sat and listened, though I&rsquo;m sure he had noticed someone was nearby.
                        Whatever that
                        song was, he played well and for a while. I lost track of time, but when he finished, he called
                        out to
                        whoever had been sitting there by him for so long. -Speak. - he said in his usual rough and
                        vulgar tone, and
                        so I walked to his front, facing him. He interrupted me as soon as I opened my mouth.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>- It&rsquo;s your fault. Though I guess there ain&rsquo;t much point in
                </span><span>gettin</span><span>&rsquo; angry at you. - His cigarette had been gone for a while now, so
                        I handed
                        him a new one and lit it for him, before lighting my own. - The tall guy, blonde at the time, I
                        think, you
                        knew it was him I was </span><span>lookin</span><span>&rsquo; for
                </span><span>didn&rsquo;cha</span><span>?
                        - I nodded - &ldquo;Heaven is coming&rdquo; an&rsquo; I was supposed to stop it. Ah, hell, you
                </span><span>tellin</span><span>&rsquo; me wouldn&rsquo;t &lsquo;</span><span>ave</span><span>&nbsp;done
                        much. -
                        He sighed, and I gave him a laugh. At first he was irritated, but then laughed back a little. I
                        told him I
                        got a couch and some old whiskey with his name on it, and after we finished our smokes, he
                        followed me back
                        into town.</span>
                <hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;">
        </p>
        <h1 class="c11" id="h.klixtx6g3iz9"><span class="c8">8: Change</span></h1>
        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">In March, the news finally arrived to the town. We were at war. The news came to
                        us
                        via the engineers in charge of the trains, but against who exactly the war was, naturally, split
                        the town
                        again, just like the flyers had. And just like the division they caused, the division caused by
                        the news of
                        war brought everyone together, motivated to discuss and argue and drink over it. It was weird, I
                        felt weird
                        about it.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Mac had been living with me then. He laughed about the war, half-heartedly, I
                        think
                        he was afraid like the rest of us. The town got even busier once it really broke out.
                        Apparently, we were a
                        vital point of the supply line and had been for a while. It was great for business, but everyone
                        hated it.
                        Non-stop work, day and night. The railyard and the docks had to temporarily hire new people, and
                        of course
                        no one wanted to welcome them into their apartments, so most of them crammed themselves into the
                        few free
                        apartments and houses there were.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">All that though, was good news for Mack. At night, he came and went as he
                        pleased. No
                        one noticed him, and on the few times he met the rest of the townsfolk, he didn&rsquo;t seem as
                        bad as the
                        rest, it was easy for people to tolerate him. Dave told me that the young looking cowboy
                        reminded him of
                        himself in his youth. Of course, I laughed, and got smacked a couple times in response, maybe
                        deservedly
                        so.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was the worst time the town had ever seen, even worse than when it was just
                        a
                        fishing settlement making do on cod and anchovies. There was no silence, there was no peace, the
                        spirits of
                        our forefathers had spoken, we were to murder our enemies with righteous retribution, whatever
                        that meant.
                        Mack had been going through a pack a day during that time, and whenever he wasn&rsquo;t smoking,
                        sitting on
                        the building&rsquo;s rooftop, he played his guitar, anxiously. I was happy to be ignorant, he
                        knew more than
                        any of us, clearly, though I was sure it had something to do with the Courier, the Courier who I
                        was sure
                        Mac had killed before coming back.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>Everyone was afraid of the future, even Richard. The few moments we had of peace, we&rsquo;d
                        often spend together. He&rsquo;d always ask me about the Courier and the Cowboy, and I&rsquo;d
                        always tell
                        him all I knew about them, which was always nothing, and he&rsquo;d always nod. - Won&rsquo;t
                        you be going
                        back home? - he asked me once, maybe halfway through April, and I shook my head. - It&rsquo;s
                        peaceful here.
                </span><span>It&rsquo;s</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;easy. - and then, he called me an idiot. When I
                        asked about
                        him, he shrugged, said - They rely on me, I can hang around a little more. - It was his way of
                        saying I was
                        wasting away there. I laughed him off, but thought he maybe had a point in what he had been
                        saying lately
                        about writing letters.</span></p>

        <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">In my final months in Whiterock, life had been turned upside down. The buzz of
                        war
                        eventually died down, our bustling little town returned to its normal pace and all the
                        part-timers were sent
                        off. That calmed the old-timers, it mortified me. We&rsquo;d never heard of the war ending,
                        we&rsquo;d only
                        stopped seeing people in army uniforms passing by. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Richard and I simply sat by, idly. He&rsquo;d been having a lot of free time due
                        to
                        putting in so much overtime during the rush, so he&rsquo;d just sit at the bar and chat with me
                        while I
                        served people. Mack however, couldn&rsquo;t take much more time sitting still in Whiterock. When
                        times began
                        getting thin, he saw the writing on the wall. His plan was to leave quietly in the night, but I
                        caught him
                        on my way back home. He didn&rsquo;t say much beyond a goodbye, didn&rsquo;t have much else to
                        say. Simply
                        told me he&rsquo;d gotten all he could out of being there, and warned me to prepare myself. I
                        didn&rsquo;t
                        have much more to ask either.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>He was to go on foot to the next town, </span><span>didn&rsquo;t</span><span
                        class="c1">&nbsp;want to wait for a train, so I asked to accompany him for a while, he laughed.
                        -
                        Can&rsquo;t stop ya, can I? - and so, I followed. We were late into April, but the cold was
                        still crushing,
                        Mac didn&rsquo;t seem to mind it though, maybe not even feel it. I thought that maybe he used
                        his cigarettes
                        to distract himself from the cold, but I couldn&rsquo;t be sure.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I lost track of time, or of where we were, I just remember sitting down by a
                        long-cold campfire, probably a camp that he had made some time before. It didn&rsquo;t take long
                        for him to
                        make a new fire and put some food by it before pulling out his guitar. He gave it all to me,
                        insisted I ate,
                        and so we shared our last song and cigarette. In the morning, he was gone. Leaving me with only
                        a blanket
                        and some embers.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">In July, a deep mist had overtaken the area. It was hard to see even a few feet
                        ahead
                        of you when outside, and no business had really happened for weeks. Trains didn&rsquo;t come by
                        anymore, the
                        few that did were mostly paid by us and the towns nearby to bring food and supplies. Spending
                        that money
                        didn&rsquo;t really bother the folk of Whiterock, they didn&rsquo;t have much use for it either
                        way, but the
                        hard times scared everyone. A lot of us took to fishing again, without much luck either.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0"><span>By August, fear really took over the town, people began remembering the war, and then the
                        flyers. &ldquo;Heaven is coming!&rdquo; </span><span>everyone</span><span
                        class="c1">&nbsp;cried, and panic
                        took over. The saddest part of it all was that we hadn&rsquo;t even seen the worst of it
                        yet.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">In September, we saw it all around us: our end had come. The warm temperatures we
                        were waiting for in March came before giving way to blizzards every single week, and then the
                        mist thinned,
                        right before turning orange. Almost everyone began locking themselves inside their homes, the
                        few who
                        didn&rsquo;t were either in someone else&rsquo;s house forming prayer groups or drinking
                        themselves to death
                        by the water.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span>Richard left a note under my door one night, directions to a camp he&rsquo;d found abandoned
                        in
                        the mountains, </span><span>told</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;me to meet him there. That was all
                        that was in
                        the note, but I knew it was about time we sat down and actually talked, eye to eye. It&rsquo;d
                        been too long
                        since we&rsquo;d last done so.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Up there, it was quieter than Silent. I couldn&rsquo;t hear anything but my own
                        footsteps, there was no wind, no birds, no moose or wolves, just my boots and the pearly-white
                        snow. It was
                        enough to calm me down, which I found weird, I wanted to be scared. But, when I got near the
                        camp, I heard
                        the crackle of wet wood. By the hill, there was a small dugout built with logs, there seemed to
                        be a fire of
                        some kind going inside. In front of it, a roaring campfire, and by it, Richard, making a snow
                        angel on the
                        ground.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">With a peaceful smile he told me to come over and get the gas mask out of my
                        face. I
                        tried to contest it, but he told me to just hear his breathing if I had any doubts, and it was
                        as clear as
                        it had always been. I took one of the rocks and sat by him after putting my bag down. He was
                        serene,
                        I&rsquo;d never seen him that way, but it made me happy. - Does this mean it&rsquo;s time for
                        you to stop
                        playing pretend? - he asked. - I&rsquo;ve tried to, already. - I replied and he sighed before
                        sitting
                        up.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">- Tomorrow I&rsquo;m going home. If I die, I want it to be as close as I can to
                        my
                        family.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">- You want help with the boat, isn&rsquo;t it?</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">- I can walk, but I don&rsquo;t think you can, and it&rsquo;s not in you to try
                        and
                        get back home by train. - He told me, rightfully, while getting up and walking into the
                        cabin.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I followed him in with my bag in hand, there were two beds &nbsp;by a fire stove,
                        it
                        looked old. - You built this? - he shook his head, said - No, found it a little after we got
                        here though. -
                        I nodded. It was cozy and warm inside. I was tired, laid down. He was looking at me, expecting
                        me to say
                        something, I caved.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">- I&rsquo;ve sent her a letter.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">- Asking for forgiveness?</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">- No right to even think about that. Just&hellip; told her I&rsquo;m sorry for
                        running, where I am, and that I want to go back if she&rsquo;ll let me.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">- You&rsquo;re not getting an answer, even if she wants you to.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I nodded again. Needing to breathe, I walked outside, and saw a great streak of
                        fire
                        ravaging far above the sky. Soon after calling Richard outside, more streaks of fire appeared,
                        and one by
                        one, they began exploding. Leviathan had come, striking the heavens and bringing them down, just
                        as Mack had
                        told me. Feeling the danger, we ran for cover in our little shack, and began talking
                        again.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Soon we decided, and the next morning we walked back into town, put all we could
                        into
                        our boat and sailed off. Times were uncertain, but we managed to keep each other lucid, and
                        after a month or
                        two of hopping from dock to dock, we managed to make it to our last destination together. It was
                        bittersweet, but ultimately I was happy for him. As the mist cleared and the weather normalized,
                        Richard
                        went back home to take care of his brothers and sisters, and I crawled back to what I had run
                        from. The next
                        year came like any other, even if we had been resigned to a world without our heaven, a world
                        with clear
                        skies.</span></p>
